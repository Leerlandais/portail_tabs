Am

C          G          C
Oh, it's a mystery to me
          C          F             G
We have a greed with which we have agreed
        F                 G                  Am
And you think you have to want more than you need
   F              G                Am
Until you have it all you won't be free

    F                   C
Society, you're a crazy breed
                G              Am
Hope you're not lonely without me...

          C                 G                  C
When you want more than you have you think you need...
             C                   F                  G
And when you think more than you want your thoughts begin to bleed
  F               G             Am
I think I need to find a bigger place
                 F                  G                   Am
Because when you have more than you think you need more space

    F                   C
Society, you're a crazy breed
                G              Am
Hope you're not lonely without me...
    F             C
Society, crazy indeed
                G              Am
Hope you're not lonely without me...

SOLO:
C - G - C  /  C - F - G  /  F - G - Am (x2)  /  F - C - G - Am

        C               G                     C
There's those thinking, more-or-less, less is more
       C             F               G
But if less is more, how you keeping score?
          F               G                Am
Means for every point you make, your level drops
F                 G                 Am
Kinda like you're starting from the top, you can't do that...

    F                   C
Society, you're a crazy breed
                G              Am
Hope you're not lonely without me...
    F          C
Society, crazy indeed
                G              Am
Hope you're not lonely without me...

    F                  C
Society, have mercy on me
                G              Am
Hope you're not angry if I disagree...
    F             C
Society, crazy indeed
                G                Am
Hope you're not lonely...without me...
